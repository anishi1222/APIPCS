# iPaaS Training by PM
When you are attending a training delivered by our iPaaS Product Management Team, you will may be using one of two domains **gse00013902** or **gse00013904** which we commonly refer to as **gse02** and **gse04** respectively

In these domains, we use Developer Cloud Service to host the tutorial content used for the training.

Your account credentials provided by your instructor (OICUser<nn>) will also get you access to the training content.  

For the **API Platform Training**, determine which domain you are using.  Ask your instructor if you are unsure.  Then use the following links:

## GSE 02
### Developer Cloud Service (Tutorial Content)
- [Tutorials](http://bit.ly/gse02-apip-devcs)  http://bit.ly/gse02-apip-devcs

>Note: You may see warning about a setup not being completed on DevCS, you can ignore this.  We are not executing builds in this DevCS, so we have not set up the storage/compute on it.

Sometimes when you navigate to this, you may find your self at the very top level of DevCS.  To get to the content, do the following:
1. Select **api-platform** project
1. Expand the left-side menu and choose **Code**
1. You will see a number of directories.  You can choose **Scenarios/warrantyClaim/README.md** for the overall lab-guide.
